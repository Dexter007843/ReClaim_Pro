# Validation from Informal User Interviews

Summary of 5 informal interviews capturing user roles, their problem statements, and reactions to the repairability score feature.

| # | User role | Problem quote | Reaction to repairability score |
|---|-----------|---------------|---------------------------------|
| 1 | Everyday User | "I can’t tell if fixing my phone is worth it or if I should just buy a new one." | Found the score clarifying; trusted it more when paired with cost comparison and a simple green/yellow/red badge. |
| 2 | Student / Budget-conscious | "I need the cheapest option, but I don’t want to get scammed on repairs." | Liked the score as a quick anchor; asked for a breakdown of why the score is high/low and links to nearby affordable shops. |
| 3 | Repair Shop Owner | "People come in unsure—half the time I’m convincing them not to junk a fixable device." | Sees the score as a pre-qualification tool; wants to embed it in intake forms and show ‘repair likelihood’ to set expectations. |
| 4 | Sustainability-minded User | "I hate tossing devices, but I don’t know the actual impact of repairing." | Appreciated the score plus CO₂/e-waste impact callouts; wants a short, human-readable explanation to share with friends. |
| 5 | Corporate IT (fleet) | "We replace laptops on schedule, but some are fine—wasteful and pricey." | Views the score as a triage signal; requested batch uploads and policy thresholds (e.g., auto-repair if score > 60). |

## Takeaways
- Pair the score with cost comparison and a clear recommendation to build trust.
- Provide short explanations and impact metrics (CO₂ saved, e-waste reduced) to motivate sustainable choices.
- Add context by role: budget users need price transparency; IT fleets need bulk triage; shops want intake-friendly embeds.
- Visual cues (color badges) help quick reading; transparency (why the score) reduces skepticism.
