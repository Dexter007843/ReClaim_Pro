# Circular Impact

Models and heuristics that estimate sustainability and circularity impact (e.g., CO₂ savings, reuse potential).

## Includes
- Emissions/energy estimation utilities
- Lifecycle benefit calculations per device type
- Recommendation builders for reuse/refurb pathways

## Notes
- Document data sources and assumptions for each metric.
